# Welcome to the Omaha Meshtastic Community 🌐

This is a **sample page** built with Markdown and a Jekyll theme.

Our mission is to connect the greater Omaha area —  
including **Council Bluffs**, **Bellevue**, **Ralston**, **Papillion**, and **Gretna** —  
through Meshtastic radios, open-source tools, and collaboration.
